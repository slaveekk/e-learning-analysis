# E-learning analytics
***
In this project I analyze data about several online courses, figure out basic stats on students' performance, their exams and the structure of the courses. Adapted RFM segmentation is used to get a deeper understanding of the school's students as a whole, their strong and weak points.
The overall students' success rate was found to be sufficient. However, I found problems with the students' time management and turning their work in on time or turning in lesser quality work to make it in time for the deadline. 

### Tools and libraries used: 
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Seaborn
* MatPlotLib

RFM segmentation is based on this [guide](https://guillaume-martin.github.io/rfm-segmentation-with-python.html).
