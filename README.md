# E-learning analytics
***
In this project I analyze data about several online courses, figure out basic stats on students' performance, their exams and the structure of the courses. Adapted RFM segmentation is used to get a deeper understanding of the school's students as a whole, their strong and weak points.

### Tools and libraries used: 
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Seaborn
* MatPlotLib

RFM segmentation is based on this [guide](https://guillaume-martin.github.io/rfm-segmentation-with-python.html).
